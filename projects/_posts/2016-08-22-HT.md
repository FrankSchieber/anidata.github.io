This is the original project that inspired the creation of Anidata.  We are working with the Fulton County District Attorney to fight human trafficking.  From the beginning, this project has involved close collaboration with the FCDA who has provided guidance as we find ways that data can aid them in their fight.  A [2016 hackathon](/blog/blog/2016/03/15/Anidata10.html){:.show-link .accent} helped get this project off the ground and involved Anidata members and the FCDA working side by side.  This project is ongoing and is currently headed by Bryant Menn.
