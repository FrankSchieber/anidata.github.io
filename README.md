## Adding blog posts to [our blog](http://anidata.org/blog/index.html)

 1) Add a markdown file to the [_posts](_posts) directory with the format `year-month-day-title.md`
 2) The top portion of the file added should contain
```
---
layout:     blog-post
title:      Descriptive title here
date:       Date of post
summary:    Short summary
---
```

The layout also determines which part of the website it is located at. "project-posts" as the layout is necessary for when creating project posts.

The rest of the file is just a standard markdown document. Just remember to add any images used in the post to [/images](images)
