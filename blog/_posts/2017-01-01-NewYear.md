Welcome to 2017! Bryant Menn has been named the lead for Anidata's Anti-Human Trafficking Project.  The human trafficking project is important to all of us, and Bryant is the clear choice for leading the project. He was an essential part of the work thus far on the project, and is an experienced data scientist at Philips Wellcentive. His professional experience leading teams combined with in-depth knowledge of the subject matter will make him an excellent lead for driving the project forward.

He will be responsible for:

* Project planning
* Coordination of management and technical decisions
* Track and report project progress
